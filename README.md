## Running the Tests

1. `make test`

## Running the application

2. `make run`

## Deployment

[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.png)](https://heroku.com/deploy)

### Setup database

- Run this command and copy the address:

`heroku config:get DATABASE_URL`

- Run this command and past it on the YOUR_DATABASE_URL:

`heroku config:set HELLPER_DSN=YOUR_DATABASE_URL`

- Import the scheema changing `YOUR_HEROKU_APP_NAME` by your application name:

`heroku pg:psql --app YOUR_HEROKU_APP_NAME < internal/model/sql/postgres/schema/hellper.sql`

- Configure your [environment variables](#Variables-explanation)

## Optional Setup

### Ngrok (To receive events from Slack)

- Download Ngrok <https://ngrok.com/> and create an account
- `sudo cp ngrok /usr/local/bin`
- `ngrok http 8080`
- Copy your public address. You'll need this to [Configure Slack API](/docs/CONFIGURING-SLACK.md)

### Golang

- Install [golang](https://golang.org/doc/install)

OR

1. Install [gvm](https://github.com/moovweb/gvm)
2. Follow gvm post install instructions
3. Install go 1.14 as default

### Database

Execute the following command inside the container:
```sh
go run ./cmd/migrations -v
```

## How to use

### Commands

After [Configuring Slack](/docs/CONFIGURING-SLACK.md) you can use the commands created. The commands are as it follows:

| Command  | Short Description |
| - | - |
|`/hellper_incident`|_Starts Incident_|
|`/hellper_status`|_Show all pinned messages_|
|`/hellper_close`|_Closes Incident_|
|`/hellper_resolve`|_Resolves Incident_|
|`/hellper_cancel`|_Cancels Incident_|
|`/hellper_pause_notify`|_Pauses incident notification_|
|`/hellper_update_dates`|_Updates the dates for an incident_|

The first command `/hellper_incident` can be use at any channel and/or conversation on Slack. It will open a pop-up for the user to set and start an Incident, creating the channel, meeting room link and post-mortem doc.

The remaining commands must be used only on the Incident's channel since they act on the specific incident that is open.

### Metrics

This metrics came from `metrics` view table, they are calculated by the following formulas:

| Metric | Description | Formula |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **start_ts** | Date and time when the incident is started | Date and time in UTC from db |
| **identification_ts** | Date and time when the incident is identified | Date and time in UTC from db |
| **end_ts** | Date and time when the incident is resolved | Date and time in UTC from db |
| **acknowledgetime** | Time To Acknowledge | `identification_ts` - `start_ts` |
| **solutiontime** | Time To Solution | `end_ts` - `identification_ts` |
| **downtime** | Time in an incident | `end_ts` - `start_ts` |
| **MTTA** | Mean Time To Acknowledge | `total acknowledgetime` / `total incidents` |
| **MTTS** | Mean Time To Solution | `total solutiontime` / `total incidents` |
| **MTTR** | Mean Time To Recovery | `total downtime` / `total incidents` |

### Alerts

Alerts are useful for notifying the status of incidents. Notifications can be used in different situations, such as requesting an update of the incident status or finalizing the post-mortem. For this you can use the CLI `notify` on your CronJob service.

To use the CLI you need to build the binary file:

```shell
go build -o notify cmd/notify/main.go
```

#### Example of use

```shell
SHELL=/bin/bash
BASH_ENV=/app/.env

# At 16:30 on every week-day, from Monday through Friday, it sends a report to a selected channel with all incidents not closed
30 16 * * 1-5 root /app/notify --type=report --to=YOUR_SLACK_CHANNEL_ID --status=all

#  Every 30th minute it sends a status update request alert for all open incidents
0/30 * * * * root /app/notify --type=channels --status=open

# At 13:30 on every week-day, from Monday through Friday, sends a post-mortem request alert for all resolved incidents
30 13 * * 1-5 root /app/notify --type=channels --status=resolved
```
